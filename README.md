# Product API

This code is highly inspired by [Devtamin's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OfL9H6AmhQ) video. There are a couple of major differences.

I have splitted server, app, routes and controllers for the backend. As for the frontend part, this project's main aim is to provide a simple interface, therefore, I used the most basic components of [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).

I will update the server-side anytime soon.
