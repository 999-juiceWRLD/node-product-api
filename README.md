# Product API

This code's backend part is highly inspired by [Devtamin's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OfL9H6AmhQ) node.js video. I decided to build it along the video, and the rest came. However, there are a couple of major differences, as such I created a frontend for this (see `/client`).

I have splitted the server, app, routes and controllers for the backend. As for the frontend part, this project's main aim is to provide a simple interface, therefore, I used the most basic components of [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).

In theory, the app contains all CRUD operations, so it's done. However, there are still things to consider & apply, but I will leave it as is. The scope of this repo was meant to be simple.

~~I will update the server-side anytime soon.~~ (at least for now)
